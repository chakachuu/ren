## What is this?

a work-in-progress portfolio that decided to grow a personality along the way.  
what started as a simple site is slowly becoming part OS-simulator, part playground, part mirror.

## ‚ú® current features

- **theme switching**  
  light, dark, and a few‚Ä¶ moods.    

- **dynamic text**  
  typewriter effects that aren‚Äôt always perfect.  
  but hey nobody's perfect right?  

- **responsive layout (hopefully)**  
  designed to feel natural across devices, though the experience can shift in subtle ways, well only *time* will tell.  

- **small details**  
  rotating footers, smooth transitions, and playful microinteractions.  
  little touches meant to keep things from feeling static.  

## üõ†Ô∏è tech stack

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (hand-rolled, caffeine-powered)  
- **CSS variables** for instant theme swapping  
- **AudioContext API** for experimenting with beat-synced effects  

## üé≠ goals

- build a portfolio that shows both design sense and technical playfulness
- make UI/UX experiments feel polished enough to live on a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù site
- explore how mood, time, and context can shift the feel of a webpage
- keep a few secrets buried in the code‚Ä¶ for those who dig deep, or stay up too late
