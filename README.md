# ren.dev — Cupertino-clean chaos

A minimalist, Apple-style personal site with **Starlight** / **Space Gray** themes, with some **delightful** twist.


---

## Features

- **Themes that behave**  
  Auto, **Starlight**, and **Space Gray** with smooth color transitions and crisp typography.

- **Beat-synced “Now Playing”**  
  Web Audio–driven pulse on the “Now Playing” label. Not a fake loop—actually listens.

- **Lyric line fade**  
  Optional LRC support to gently morph the hero title line by line.

- **Typewriter with chaos control**  
  Intentionally scuffed typos that fix themselves mid-sentence. (Perfectionism with drama.)

- **Footer quip rotator**  
  “Powered by caffeine and questionable life choices.” and friends.

- **Single-file simplicity**  
  One `index.html`. No build. No frameworks. Just go.

- **Tasteful easter eggs**  
  Hidden interactions exist. No, they’re not in this README. Touch grass. Or the logo. Or neither. Who knows.

## Contents

- `index.html` — the entire site, including styles and scripts
- `logo.svg` — default mark (also works as favicon)
- `1800.mp3` — audio track for the takeover (file name referenced in the page)
