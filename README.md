# Ren’s Humble Abode 🏚️

a work-in-progress portfolio that decided to grow a personality along the way.  
what started as a simple site is slowly becoming part OS-simulator, part playground, part mirror.

## ✨ current features

- **theme switching**  
  light, dark, and a few… moods.    

- **dynamic text**  
  typewriter effects that aren’t always perfect.  
  but hey nobody's perfect right?  

- **responsive layout (hopefully)**  
  designed to feel natural across devices, though the experience can shift in subtle ways, well only *time* will tell.  

- **small details**  
  rotating footers, smooth transitions, and playful microinteractions.  
  little touches meant to keep things from feeling static.

## 🛠️ tech stack

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (hand-rolled, caffeine-powered)  
- **CSS variables** for instant theme swapping  
- **AudioContext API** for experimenting with beat-synced effects  

## 🎭 goals

- build a portfolio that shows both design sense and technical playfulness
- make UI/UX experiments feel polished enough to live on a “professional” site
- explore how mood, time, and context can shift the feel of a webpage
- keep a few secrets buried in the code… for those who dig deep, or stay up too late

## 🖤 notes

this repo is intentionally still messy, i’m letting it grow in public.
all in all it's probably one of my best work so far so take a decent look at it, or maybe don't stare at it too much, it'll stare back at you.
